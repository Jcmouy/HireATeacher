# HireATeacher App Andorid

Application developed for Andorid, designed with the idea of providing a simple solution for those students who want to hire a private tutor.

Detailed explanation:

The system links the need of students, when hiring private teachers, providing the necessary support to advance and pass the courses or subject; with the supply of teachers who teach private classes, through a sophisticated geolocation system, which allows locating the teachers, academies and students in a certain geographic space. 

The Student can visualize the location of the teachers who give private classes in a certain area, being able to determine the search radius, as well as the subjects, the qualifications that each teacher has, given by the students, the modalities of teaching the classes (face-to-face, blended, online, at the Academy, at home) and the schedule of the classes. 
From the application of these filters, the system displays on the map the location of those teachers who meet the established conditions. From there, the Student can choose the Teacher he/she prefers by clicking on the mark on the map. 

The system displays the different means or modalities to make the payment and complete the corresponding hiring process. Upon successful completion of this process, the data will be displayed so that both (Teacher and Student) can contact each other (email, chat), and the telephone or cell phone number can be displayed if the user allows it, as well as the address if necessary.
